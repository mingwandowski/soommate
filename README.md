# Soommate

Soommate is a simple rent distribution system, mainly face to like 3 or 4 friends would like to rent an apartment together. Since there are different kinds of rooms like master bedroom with own restroom or small bedroom with a shared restroom, or even someone may live in the living room. And also different people have different budgets. There is always gonna be some problem that how to value each bedroom and which bedroom each of them should choose.

Actually this is one thing that bothered us when we moved into our present apartment so that comes out this application. The basic idea is that you can create a big "Room" with different actual "rooms" to be chosen. And since we have fixed the total price of the whole "Room", each tenant could value each room. In other words, they can give out the highest price they are willing to accept for each room. After all the tenants have finished their valuation, it will find the best combination with the highest total amount of price and averaged to everyone. So that everyone has their best choice of the room and a good price which is lower than their valuation. 

Apologize for the stability of the application. The amount check has been fixed, but there is still much work that needs to be done such as rent username authorization, a lot of details. I will fix them step by step.

There is a demo account for new users to see how it worked.
